LiD Presentation Notes

1. Intro Slide

    ~ Who I am
    ~ What this is

2. What is LiD

    ~ Clue's in the name
    ~ Shares a lot of techniques with SI & ASR

3. Who Cares?

    ~ Ethnologue statistics

4. LDI

    ~ We can visualise this with a measure known as LDI
    ~ Those locations with the highest LDI measure are in emerging economies
    ~ So who cares? Businesses might.

5. India LDI

    ~ One of the largest emerging economies, clear to see the benefits of LiD

6. Practical

    ~ Uses

7. Language Differences

    ~ Phonemes - smallest distinct linguistic measure
    ~ Prosody - pitch curves, rhythm, intonation
    ~ Phonotactics - the rules behind the sequencing of phonemes
    ~ Syntax - the rules that govern the sequence of larger structures such as words

8. What Can humans Do?

    ~ Infancy - studies show that spinal transduction of sound from glottis clearly audible in womb.
    ~ No wonder this leads to prosodic bias

9. Previous Attempts/10. A simpler Approach...

    ~ All statistical
    ~ Given human abilities, logical to deduce that acoustical features play a great part in the brain's pattern classification

11. System Overview

12. Feature Extraction

    ~nPVI measure from Grabe & Low - wrote myself

13. MFCCs

    ~ A practical and compact way of showing the power spectrum of a signal.
    ~ If you want to love the maths then you can.

14. nPVI Function

    ~ All these features ended up giving values between 0-1, good for WEKA

15. Classification
    
    ~ Used a MLP
    ~ Also used Na√Øve Bayes as a 'lazy function' to compare against

16. WEKA

17. Comparisons Made

18. Results

19. Robustness

20. What's next

21. Towards Babelfish
